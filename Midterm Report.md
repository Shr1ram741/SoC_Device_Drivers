Knowledge before the project:<br>
I honestly knew only the bare minimum of coding required for this project, from my CS101 and my CS104 (SSL) courses, which included basic C++ programming and basic knowledge of shells and the Linux terminal.

Learnings during the Project:<br>
Week 1:<br>
What a process is, what components a process has, and how the operating system goes about setting up a process.<br>
How the data from a process is stored in memory, and how the OS switches between processes.<br>
How the OS manages to monitor and control processes, and prevents them from accessing unauthorised objects in the device.<br>
A brief overview of how memory appears to processes as virtual memory, and how it is mapped to physical memory.

Week 2:<br>
The different modes in which a process can run: user mode and kernel mode<br>
How a process can switch between the privileged kernel mode and the unprivileged user mode using system calls<br>
Different system calls (fork(), exec(), wait(), exit())<br>
Basic introduction to a shell<br>
Signals sent to a process by the OS and other processes, their functions, and how these signals are handled by processes (SIG_DFL, SIG_IGN or custom signal handlers)<br>

Week 3:<br>
A deeper dive into virtual memory<br>
Methods of translating virtual memory to physical memory - Base to Bounds, Segmenting, Paging<br>
TLBs (Translation lookaside buffers)<br>
Designing custom memory managers for processes<br>
